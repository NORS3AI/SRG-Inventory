- Record supplier/lab information
- Monitor expected delivery dates
- Update status when shipment arrives

#### 2.2 Receiving & Initial Processing
- Log date arrived from lab
- Record batch number

- Glass vial tracking

#### 2.3 Testing Workflow
- Track date sent for testing
- Record testing facility
- Monitor testing turnaround time
- Log date results received

  - Peptides with existing inventory
  - Oldest received items first
  - Highest demand items prioritized
- Most pressing needs displayed at top
- Hide peptides with no inventory

#### 3.3 Labeling Status
- Track labeled vs. unlabeled inventory
- Record date labeled
- Associate labels with specific batches
- Track who performed labeling

### 4. Sales Readiness Validation

#### 4.1 Three-Point Check System
Before a peptide can be sold, it must have:
1. **Purity results** - Test results showing acceptable purity
2. **Net weight** - Confirmed actual weight from testing
3. **Label** - Physical vial has been labeled

#### 4.2 Sales Dashboard
- Display only sales-ready inventory
- Show which peptides are blocked (missing requirements)
- Indicate what's missing for each blocked peptide
- Estimated time to sales-ready status

### 5. Reporting & Analytics

- Current stock levels across all peptides
- Items needing immediate attention
- Ordering recommendations
- Historical inventory trends

#### 5.2 Operational Metrics
- Average time from order to receipt
- Testing turnaround times
- Labeling throughput
- Bottleneck identification

#### 5.3 Financial Insights
- Inventory value by status
- Pending orders value
- Sales-ready inventory value
- Cost of stock-outs

### 6. Data Management

#### 6.1 Data Persistence
- Local database for all records
- Automatic backups

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 7. Pick List Scanner (In Progress)

#### 7.1 Overview
OCR-based scanner to photograph paper pick lists and automatically deduct sold quantities from labeled inventory counts. Eliminates manual counting of 40-70+ paper pick lists each morning.

#### 7.2 Template Support
Two pick list formats from WooCommerce fulfillment:
- **Template A (Structured)**: Table/grid layout with product name, net weight, quantity columns
- **Template B (Visual)**: Large text format, sometimes includes product images

#### 7.3 Workflow
1. Select pick list template (A or B)
2. Photograph each pick list sheet (camera or gallery upload)
3. OCR extracts product names and quantities from each photo
4. System aggregates totals across all scanned sheets automatically
5. User reviews running tally, corrects any OCR misreads
6. One-tap "Apply" deducts totals from labeled inventory counts

#### 7.4 Problem Solved
- WooCommerce inventory numbers are unreliable due to indefinite cart holds
- Pick lists (completed orders) are the source of truth for actual sales
- Currently requires manual counting 100+ times across 40-70 paper sheets daily
- Scanner automates aggregation — user just photographs and taps Apply

#### 7.5 Status
- Skeleton UI complete with template selection, scan area, running tally, and apply button
- OCR integration pending — needs physical template samples to calibrate recognition
- Will match OCR-extracted product names against existing inventory product list

### 8. Inventory Comparison & Snapshots

#### 8.1 Snapshot System
- Automatic daily snapshots of inventory state
- Manual snapshots with custom labels
- CSV import as snapshots for comparing older inventory data
- Max 1000 items per comparison

#### 8.2 Compare Two Snapshots
- Side-by-side comparison of any two snapshots
- Summary cards: Units Sold, Restocked, New Products, Removed
- Filter by change type (Decreased, Increased, New, Removed, Unchanged)
- Sortable, reorderable columns

#### 8.3 Trend Over Time
- Multi-snapshot trend view across selectable time ranges (1wk, 2wk, 1mo, all)
- Color-coded quantity changes between consecutive snapshots
- Net change column showing overall movement per product
