🔗 **[Live Demo: https://nors3ai.github.io/PIMS/](https://nors3ai.github.io/PIMS/)**

A comprehensive inventory management solution designed specifically for PIMS, a peptide manufacturing and distribution company. This system streamlines the entire peptide lifecycle from ordering through testing to labeling and sales readiness.

## 🌟 Overview

The PIMS Inventory System manages three critical aspects of peptide operations:

1. **Inventory Tracking** - Real-time stock levels with color-coded visual indicators
2. **Lifecycle Management** - Complete tracking from order placement through testing and labeling
3. **Sales Readiness** - Automated validation ensuring only compliant products are marked for sale

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Inventory Management
- **CSV Import/Export** - Support for both "Replace All" and "Update Existing" modes
- **Color-coded Stock Status** for instant visibility:
  - 🔴 **RED**: Out of stock (immediate action)
  - 🟠 **ORANGE**: Nearly out of stock (urgent)
  - 🟡 **YELLOW**: Low stock (order soon)
  - 🟢 **GREEN**: Good stock (no action needed)
  - 🔵 **TEAL**: On order (in transit)
- **Smart Filtering** - Filter by status, search across multiple fields
- **Customizable Columns** - Reorder, hide/show columns, drag-and-drop
- **Quick Edit Modal** - Fast inline editing with auto-save
- **Product Exclusions** - Exclude specific products from future imports

### 🧪 Peptide Lifecycle Tracking
Track every stage of your peptide journey:
- Order placement and arrival dates
- Testing submission and results dates
- Purity percentage tracking
- Net weight verification
- Batch number assignment
- Quantity tracking (MG)
- Ordered quantity and status
- Complete order history per peptide

### 🏷️ Smart Label Management
- **Label Inventory Tracking** - Add/remove labels from inventory
- **Visual Progress Bar** - See overall labeling completion at a glance
- **Prioritized Queue** - Automatically prioritizes based on:
  - Stock quantity (higher = more urgent)
  - Sales readiness (has purity + net weight)
  - Low stock items (urgent to move)
  - Velocity data (known sellers)
- **Recently Labeled** - Top 10 most recently labeled products
- **Percentage-Based Colors**:
  - 0-25%: Red (needs labeling)
  - 26-50%: Yellow (partial)
  - 51-75%: Green (good progress)
  - 76-100%: Teal (mostly/fully labeled)
- **Smart Filtering** - Excludes products with zero quantity
- **Scroll Controls** - Navigate through long lists with up/down buttons

### ✅ Sales Readiness Validation
Automated three-point check system ensures peptides can only be sold when they have:
1. ✓ Purity test results
2. ✓ Net weight confirmation
3. ✓ Applied label

**Sales Ready Dashboard** shows:
- Total sales-ready products
- Blocked products with missing requirements
- Breakdown of missing requirements (purity, weight, label)

### 📈 Reports & Analytics
- **Comprehensive Reports** - Detailed inventory analysis
- **Sales Velocity Tracking** - Historical velocity data (up to 10 previous imports)
- **Transaction Tracking** - Record sales and inventory movements
- **Export Capabilities** - Export to CSV format
- **Charts & Visualizations** - Visual progress indicators

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Dark Mode** - Full dark mode support across all components
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Tab Persistence** - Remembers your active tab across refreshes
- **Scroll Position Preservation** - No more jumping to top when editing
- **Toast Notifications** - Clear feedback for all actions
- **Confirmation Dialogs** - Prevent accidental data loss

   - **Required**: Product, SKU, Quantity
   - **Optional**: Batch #, Purity, Net Weight, Velocity, etc.

### Managing Labels

1. Go to **Labeling** tab
2. Add labels to inventory using the "Add Labels" button
3. Work through the priority queue:
   - Items are automatically sorted by priority
   - Click "Apply Label" to label products
   - Track progress with the visual progress bar
4. View recently labeled items in the bottom section

### Checking Sales Readiness

3. See which requirements are missing for blocked items
4. Filter by Ready, Blocked, or All items

### Managing Orders

2. Create new order with quantity and date
3. Update order status as it progresses:
   - Submitted for testing
   - Testing complete
   - Results received
4. View complete order history

### Viewing Reports

1. Go to **Reports** tab

3. Export data to CSV
4. Track sales velocity and trends

## 🎯 Business Context

PIMS manufactures and distributes research peptides. The company:
- Receives peptide shipments in glass vials from external labs
- Must send each batch for purity and weight testing
- Can only sell peptides that have passed testing and been properly labeled
- Needs to maintain optimal inventory levels across multiple peptide types
- Requires quick visual identification of stock issues and operational bottlenecks

This system ensures compliance, streamlines operations, and provides real-time visibility into inventory status.

## 🔒 Data Storage

All data is stored **locally in your browser** using IndexedDB:
- ✅ No server required
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Fast performance
- ✅ Privacy-focused (your data never leaves your device)

**Note**: Clear browser data will delete your inventory. Use the Export feature regularly to backup your data.
